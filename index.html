    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Meet John! He's a software engineer from Ohio who loves to play guitar and hike in his free time. John was born and
    raised in Cleveland and has always had a passion for technology. He attended the Ohio State University where he
    earned a degree in computer science.

    John is an avid coffee drinker and has a collection of over 20 different coffee mugs from all around the world. He
    enjoys trying out new coffee blends and brewing methods and can often be found experimenting in his kitchen. In
    addition to coffee, John is also a bit of a foodie and loves trying out new restaurants and cuisines.

    When he's not coding or enjoying coffee, John loves to play guitar. He's been playing for over 10 years and can play
    a variety of different styles, including rock, blues, and folk. John also enjoys hiking and spending time outdoors.
    He's completed several multi-day backpacking trips in the Appalachian Mountains and hopes to one day hike the
    Pacific Crest Trail.

    In his spare time, John volunteers at a local animal shelter and loves spending time with his dog, a golden
    retriever named Charlie. He's passionate about animal rights and hopes to one day start his own animal rescue
    organization. Despite being a bit of an introvert, John is always up for trying new things and loves to challenge
    himself. He's recently taken up meditation and has found it to be a great way to reduce stress and improve his
    focus.

    Overall, John is a driven and passionate individual who values personal growth and making a positive impact in the
    world.
